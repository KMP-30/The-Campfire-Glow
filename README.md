# The-Campfire-Glow
# Themsi Patel - October 1, 2024 (REMIX- Kavya) Glow as we come along

Under the Rocks,
with a sparkling flame, 
We fein along, 
to this simple song 
The campfire glows. 
and the magic fly,
**GLOWING** the night,
like Radahn's sky

So come gather along,
and feel the night, 
Our festives not done, 
it's far from dyin, 
Add your verse,
and pass it on until we get wasted till the other night.

The trees sway softly, 
in the nights breese, 
Whispers of my stories carried by my fleet. 
The moon above, 
with its glowing touch of its pearly light,
Guides our voices through the night.

The flames grow higher, 
sparks touch the sky, 
We sing together, 
you and I. 
With each new verse,
the fire burns bright
A song of warmth, 
through the endless night

So sing with me, 
and don't be shy, 
Our voices blend as the hours go by.
The campfire glow will forever stay,
In our hearts, 
even as night turns to day.
