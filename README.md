# The-Campfire-Glow
# Themsi Patel - October 1, 2024

Under the stars,
with a crackling flame, 
We sing along, 
to this simple song 
The campfire glows. 
and embers fly,
Lighting the night,
like fireflies

So come gather around,
and feel the heat, 
Our song's not done, 
it's far from complete, 
Add your verse,
and pass it on until the night is all gone.

The trees sway softly, 
in the cool night breese, 
Whispers of stories carried by the leaves. 
The moon above, 
with its gentle light,
Guides our voices through the night.

The flames grow higher, 
sparks touch the sky, 
We sing together, 
you and I. 
With each new verse,
the fire burns bright
A song of warmth, 
through the endless night

So sing with me, 
and don't be shy, 
Our voices blend as the hours go by.
The campfire glow will forever stay,
In our hearts, 
even as night turns to day.
